          Howdy! My name is Maddie Bramlett, and I am a junior at Texas A&M University in
          Computer Science with a minor in Business. I'm from Dallas, Texas, and went to high school
          at the School for the Talented and Gifted at Townview. I fell in love with computer science
          during my freshman year of high school and have taken coding ever since! I love the way
          problem-solving is approached in coding and the collaboration of ideas to create a solution.
          <br><br>
          Even though I have a love for problem-solving and the mindset of software development, I could
          not picture myself as a software developer in the future. I love interacting with others, and
          I know I want to incorporate people into my career. This past summer, I completed an internship
          with Mary Kay on their Information Services and Technology team, and I found myself enjoying the
          project management side of development. I loved getting to see all of the puzzle pieces for the
          upcoming project and watching my mentor strategize with her team. Additionally, I would love to
          experience the front-end side of coding, though I do not have any prior experience with it yet.
          <br><br>
          Outside of coding, I have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy (if I have the time!). I grew up loving music
          and took piano lessons for most of my life. Nowadays, I sing in the <a href="https://centurysingers.tamu.edu/">Century Singers</a> 
          choir on campus to fill my need for creating music. I also love baking and am the president of Cupcakes for a Cause on 
          campus. On the weekends, I also love playing video games with friends and spending time with my fiance. 
          When I'm home, I love doing puzzles with my mom and hanging out with my family. We just adopted a new 
          kitten, Tinkerbell, and she has definitely added a lot of energy to our family. That's me in a nutshell!
