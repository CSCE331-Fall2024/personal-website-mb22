    <u>Technical Skills</u><br>As listed on my resume, I have coding skills in C++ and Java. I worked in Java
    throughout all of high school, and most of my college courses have been in C++. Additionally, we have done 
    basics in Python, Scheme, and now HTML at A&M. I learned <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm">Apex</a> 
    in my internship at Mary Kay over the summer, and it is incredibly similar to Java.
    <br><br>
    <u>Areas of Interest</u><br>I am very interested in learning more about front-end development. I have not really
    done much on the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/blog/what-is-ux-ui-design/">UI/UX</a> side, other than observing some facets of design during my internship. I am interested
    in seeing if I would enjoy working with the side users see more than back-end, as I enjoy working closely with
    people and plan to incorporate working with others into my career.
