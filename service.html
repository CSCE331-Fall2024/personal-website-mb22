      <div class="txt2"><p>
          I love baking, so I joined the organization <a href="https://cfactamu.wixsite.com/cfac">Cupcakes for a Cause</a>
          as a freshman. The goal of Cupcakes for a Cause is to raise money for local charities in the Bryan/College Station
          area by selling homemade cupcakes. We hold bake nights every Wednesday night at different officers' housing, and
          every Thursday, we sell the freshly baked cupcakes to anyone passing by. We sell each cupcake for $2, or you can buy
          3 cupcakes for $5.
          <br><br>
          I was the Community Service Coordinator for CFAC in Fall 2023, and last semester, I became the president of the
          organization! I really enjoy giving back to the community, and I love providing students at A&M a fun way to meet
          other students that are creative and enjoy helping different charities. The charity we are donating to this semester 
          is <a href="https://www.scottyshouse.org/about/">Scotty's House</a>! While I've been a part of CFAC, we've donated to
          <a href="https://aggielandhumane.org/">Aggieland Humane Society</a>, <a href="https://www.elderaid.net/about-us">Elder Aid</a>, and
          <a href="https://unboundnow.org/bcs">Unbound Now BCS</a>!
